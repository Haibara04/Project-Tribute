			<p id="tribute-info">Learning to appreciate a parent takes time. Sometimes it is even an uphill climb. Eventually, life sets you straight. That's when you learn your parents are great. Now, it's time to say thanks. Parents are the first teachers and God on earth for their children. It is their unlimited love, unending care, and unaccountable selflessness that they pour up on us, giving us strength to stand tall against all odds. Whatever and whoever we become in life, our parents always leave a perennial and profound imprint on our very soul. It is because of them that we become dreamers of life. It is because of them that we desire for, and become passionate about success. It is because of them that we learn to love and care. And it is because of them that we are human. We learn everything about life from them. Right from first footsteps to the footsteps we create for ourselves in life with out careers and lives are all inspired and materialized by them. The very first words we speak to the words that we speak now are all the voices of love that our parents echoed within us during our upbringing. When we achieve something we want and become successful, more than us, our parents are filled with ecstacy and pride. All the while they were saying that silent prayer for our success, blessing us each second. Our dreams become their dreams, and our success becomes their success. They forgive our every mistake. They are with us in times of failure. When we are down, they are there to put that smile back on our face, for they can never see tear in our eyes. Tears overflow in their eyes if we are in tears. Our parents are our greatest treasure and gift. Without them, we are nothing, nothing at all. These words and thoughts can never sum up what our parents are. They can only remind us of how much they have given us their sacrifices even it takes their own breath. We can only say and repeat, "Mom, Dad, I love you so much." Thank you, thank you, thank you to you, our parents, for everything you've done to us. These words are from within our deepest hearts.</p>
